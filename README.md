# Memory

Memory is a React.js game. This application is broken into UI components, manages component state, and responds to user click events.

### How to Play
* The object of the game is to click on an image only once, and the images shuffle after each click in order to test your memory.
* The application displays different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.
* The application keeps track of the user's score. The score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. 
* The score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
* Every time an image is clicked, the images on the page shuffle in random order.
* When the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
* When the user correctly clicks on every image only once, the user wins and the game restarts.
